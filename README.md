Contract Extraction Repository

This repository provides a powerful tool for extracting essential information from contracts using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project is structured into several components to facilitate both the backend processing and user interaction.

Components

Contract_Extraction.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the core algorithms and methodologies for extracting contract data. It processes contract text to identify key elements such as clauses, terms, and dates.
index.html: The HTML interface allows users to upload contracts and view the extracted information seamlessly.
script.js: This JavaScript file implements client-side functionalities, enhancing user interaction and ensuring a responsive experience.
styles.css: The CSS file styles the HTML interface, ensuring a clean and professional layout.
Features

Data Extraction: Extract key terms and clauses from contracts with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive web interface for ease of use.
Customizable: Easily modify the extraction algorithms and interface to suit specific needs.
